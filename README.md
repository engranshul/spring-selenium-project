## What is this project

This is a project that i created to automate some flows on oyo website using selenium as a part
of learning.This project can be helpful if you want to use spring with selenium. All the proper
coding conventions have been followed in this project.

## TechStack used:

* Java Spring Project
* Selenium
* Maven
* TestNg
* ApacheLog4J2

## Feature Details :

* Flow execution starts with providing runtime arguments like "headless=true/false",browser="mozilla/chrome" 
  to sanity.xml.In future same can be provided by Jenkins.
* Page objects classes are defined page wise and these page classes will have locators of elements on that page.
  This will ensure maintainability in future as all the locators are managed at a single place.
* All test classes (OyoFlowOne,OyoFlowTwo etc) extends DriverBase class.This is done so that initialization and
  clean up activities can be done automatically.No need for explicit calling from each testclass.
* Config is managed in a class named Constants.
* DriverFactory takes care of give instance of browser based on browser type.It has been designed in such a way 
  that in future support for new browsers can be added with minimum change.
* Reports are generated by Testng in target/surefire-reports after test execution. 
* Binary downloader plugin has been used so that no need to explicit download drivers for each browser,os.
* It downloads all drivers automatically before test execution starts.
* Checkout file with this path :final/src/test/resources/RepositoryMap.xml . for understanding its usage.


## TestCase and Execution Details :

* I have created a total of 8 testcases.Command to instantiate execution.Run it from project directory having 
  pom.xml.Make sure your browser version is compatible.
* mvn clean test -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver="src/test/resources/selenium_standalone_binaries/osx/marionette/64bit/geckodriver"  -Dheadless=false -DsuiteXmlFile=sanity.xml   
* ShortVideo explaining code and showing overall execution.
